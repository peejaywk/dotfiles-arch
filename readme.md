### dotfile configurations for my Arch Linux builds. 

- This has been mainly setup to configure my Arch based computers. Saying that, it will almost certainly work with any Linux or Mac based system.
- This setup is heavily inspired by [Mischa van den Burg](https://www.github.com/mischavandenburg) and the Kubecraft community.
- Using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) to manage and deploy my dotfiles.
